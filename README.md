At this stage, please use the GCTechSpace discussion list for general discussion about configuration items (eg code) on here,
as well as the 'Issue' facility for *clearly defined* issues, ie please define any issue -
 - clearly,
 - unambiguously and
 - concisely. Go on, try your best grammar; eg "She's broke, mate." will not cut it!
